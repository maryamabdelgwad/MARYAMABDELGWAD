 ## 👋🏻 Hey, I'm Maryam!

I'm a *BIS student* — someone who believes that curiosity, code, and connection can build something powerful.

Right now, I’m exploring the intersection of:
- 📊 Data Analysis
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & ML
- 💻 Business Technology & Systems

I’m building my path one repo at a time, while learning Python, SQL, Power BI, and AI fundamentals through various platforms.  
(Yes, I’m currently working on a one-month AI/Data project — excited to share it soon!)



 💼 A bit about what I do

- Working in *remote customer service*, solving real-world problems daily
- Studying full-time in *CIC* (BIS program – GPA: 3.5)
- Taking online certifications in *Data Science, **AI, and **Tech Empowerment*
- Volunteering with global communities like *Dubai Youth Summit*



 🧠 But I didn’t start here...

Before tech, I was just a girl who asked questions.  
Questions led to workshops. Workshops led to projects.  
Projects led to code. And now, here I am — slowly shaping a future where I can solve problems that matter.

Along the way, I’ve:
- Conducted workshops for kids 👧🏻 
- Led charity events & managed marketing teams 💡  
- Designed visuals, built systems, and designed presentations 🎨  
- And talked to a LOT of people — in 2 languages 🌍



 ✨ Little Wins I'm Proud Of

- 🏆 Represented Egypt at the *Dubai Global Youth Summit*
- 👩🏻‍🏫 Delivered customer support across international clients at *Concentrix*
- 🤝🏻 Participated in 15+ national programs like *Girls in Tech, **InnovEgypt, and **FemPower*
- 🧠 Completed AI courses by *Cisco, **AWS, and **Udacity*
- 🎯 Fluent in English, native Arabic speaker, beginner in German



 🌱 Things I’m working on

- 🔍 *Data Analysis Project* – DataSamurai challenge  
- 🏥 *HeartHaven* – A breast cancer support system (SAD project)  
- 📈 *Business Dashboard* – Built in Power BI for retail analysis  



 💓 Fun (but true) facts

- I talk to ChatGPT like it’s my bestfriend🤖  
- I speak fast — especially when I’m excited🤪  
- I deeply care about people, growth, and doing work that means something!
